## The Beginning of Online Connections

### Six Degrees (1997)

Founded by **Andrew Weinreich** in 1997, **SixDegrees.com** pioneered online social networking by introducing user profiles, friend lists, connections, and viewing friends' networks. It was the **first true social networking site**, establishing a new paradigm for digital interaction that would later influence major platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn.[[1]](#1)

The platform's name referenced the popular *"six degrees of separation"* concept, emphasizing the possibility of worldwide connections through just a handful of personal links.[[2]](#2) Although revolutionary, SixDegrees faced challenges attracting sustained user interest and generating sufficient income, ultimately shutting down operations in December 2000.[[3]](#3)[[7]](#7)

Though SixDegrees was **ahead of its time**, it showed that people wanted to connect with each other online in a social-networked way. It proved that creating online communities was a viable concept, even though society was not fully ready for such a platform in the late 1990s.

Ultimately, SixDegrees served as a **crucial precursor** to today's social media landscape, and its fundamental approach of connecting individuals through mutual acquaintances and social connections became a blueprint that shaped numerous platforms that followed.[[4]](#4)

## Early 2000s â€“ Networking Takes Off

The early 2000s saw the rise of social networking sites that catered to different needs.

### Friendster (2002-2003)

    </sup>
</p>

One of the earliest platforms to combine social interaction with entertainment and fun spaces, **Friendster** emphasized connecting people based on mutual friends.[[4]](#4)

Founded in 2002 (launched in 2003) by **Jonathan Abrams** and initially based in Mountain View, California, Friendster rapidly gained traction as a popular social networking platform, allowing users to create detailed profiles, connect with friends, and discover new people through mutual connections.[[6]](#6)

Its core functionalities included:

- Creating detailed and personalized user profiles
- Friend lists based on real-life connections
- Discovering new people through mutual connections
- Public endorsements called *"testimonials"*
- Private messaging
- Topic-driven groups and interest-based communities

Friendster was unique for its focus on **real identities and social relationships**, encouraging connections through a *"circle of friends"* approach.[[7]](#7)

While it was a **trendsetter** and directly inspired platforms like MySpace and Facebook, Friendster's downfall stemmed from server instability, technical glitches, poor user experience, and rivals outperforming it in usability and scalability.[[8]](#8)[[9]](#9)

After its decline as a social network, Friendster relaunched as a social gaming platform in June 2011, reaching over **115 million registered users**.[[5]](#5) However, the platform eventually suspended all services in 2015, citing "the evolving landscape in our challenging industry" and lack of user engagement.[[9]](#9)

### MySpace (2003)

        </a>
    </sup>
</p>

**MySpace** sparked a wave of digital self-expression by allowing extensive profile customization with personal information and photos, user-integrated blogs, ability to share music, fostering unprecedented creativity and freedom. MySpace also included messaging, comments, and groups, fostering a sense of community.[[10]](#10)

Launched in August 2003 by **Tom Anderson** and **Chris DeWolfe**, MySpace quickly became the world's most popular social networking site in the mid-2000s.[[11]](#11)[[26]](#26)

Its signature **'Top 8' friends list**, blogging tools, and embedded music players attracted artists and musicians seeking visibility and promoting their work.[[67]](#67) Its music integration helped launch artists like **Arctic Monkeys**, whose fans created a viral MySpace community sharing bootleg tracks, and **Lily Allen**, who used the platform to directly upload demos that became chart-topping hits.[[68]](#68)[[77]](#77) This demonstrated MySpace's unique capacity to **bypass traditional industry gatekeepers**.[[12]](#12) By August 2006, MySpace had over **100 million registered users**, surpassing Google as the most visited website in the U.S.[[13]](#13)

Its high level of personalization and focus on music set it apart, making it a cultural and technological milestone and it was acquired by News Corporation for **580 million dollars**.[[14]](#14) The acquisition of MySpace provided significant revenue through a deal with Google worth **900 million dollars**, a three-year search and advertising partnership that effectively recouped News Corp's initial investment.[[15]](#15)[[24]](#24)[[25]](#25)[[12]](#12)

However, post-2008 its dominance was rapidly eroded with the rise of Facebook, offering a minimalist interface, cleaner design, better user experience, and enhanced privacy features. By the early 2010s, MySpace had rebranded as a music-focused platform but never regained its former position. News Corp later sold MySpace to Specific Media for **\$35 million** in 2011.[[16]](#16)

Despite its fall, MySpace paved the way for future social media platforms by showing the power of online communities, user-generated content, and personalized digital identities, making it a **cultural and technological milestone** in the development of social networking, before Facebook eventually overtook it.[[17]](#17)

### LinkedIn (2003)

<p align="center">

    </sup>
</p>

Professional networking made its debut, turning the digital world into a place for **career development** and **business connections**.

[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com)'s early development can be traced back to co-founder **Reid Hoffman**'s living room in 2002, with its formal launch occurring on May 5, 2003, by Hoffman along with Allen Blue, Konstantin Guericke, Eric Ly, and Jean-Luc Vaillant. It pioneered **professional-focused social networking platform**, providing a dedicated space for career management and business engagement.[[18]](#18)

Unlike other early social platforms focused on personal or entertainment-based connections, LinkedIn emphasized **real identities**, **formal networking**, and **career development**. Users crafted comprehensive profiles functioning as digital CVs and resume, documenting professional backgrounds, academic credentials, work history, skills & competencies, and professional endorsements. This enabled professionals to connect with colleagues, mentors, and industry peers.[[19]](#19)

Core functionalities encompassed:

- Job listings
- Direct communication channels and messaging
- Testimonials and peer recommendations
- Skill endorsements
- Professional communities
- Content-sharing tools

The introduction of **LinkedIn Learning** further bolstered its educational offerings through career-oriented courses.[[20]](#20)[[73]](#73)

By prioritizing workplace relevance, LinkedIn became indispensable for talent acquisition teams, businesses, enterprises, organizations, and career aspirants, reshaping digital-era recruitment methodologies.[[21]](#21)

Microsoft's 2016 acquisition for **\$26.2 billion** accelerated LinkedIn's expansion, surpassing **900 million global members** (not daily active users). It continues leading professional engagement spheres, redefining organizational and individual growth strategies through networking and collaboration.[[22]](#22)[[23]](#23)

### Facebook (2004)

</p>

**The Giant Emerges!**

Initially named "TheFacebook", the platform debuted in 2004 as a **Harvard-exclusive network** co-founded by **Mark Zuckerberg**, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. Later in 2005 after the purchase of the domain facebook.com, it was renamed to [Facebook](https://facebook.com) and slowly expanded to other universities and eventually to the general public.[[28]](#28)

The platform enabled:

- Detailed profile customization
- Adding friends
- Sharing updates and multimedia content
- Engagement via messaging and interactions through likes, comments and shares

Its **2006 News Feed innovation**, aggregating real-time peer updates transformed how people consume content and interact with each other online.[[29]](#29)

Facebook also introduced the concept of **"Pages"** for businesses, celebrities, and public figures, allowing them to interact with fans directly.[[30]](#30)

Over the years, strategic acquisitions including **Instagram (2012)**, **WhatsApp (2014)**, and **Oculus VR (2014)** diversified Facebook's ecosystem, expanding its influence in the social media landscape.[[28]](#28)[[69]](#69) October 28, 2021, rebranding to **Meta** reflected the company's vision and its ambitions beyond traditional social media into immersive virtual worlds termed as the *metaverse*.[[31]](#31)

Despite facing challenges such as privacy concerns, the spread of misinformation, and competition from newer platforms, Facebook has stayed at the forefront of global social networking, with **billions of active users** worldwide.

### Twitter (2006)

        </a>
    </sup>
</p>

Originally launched in July 2006 under the name **"Twttr"** (six months later it was renamed to Twitter), the microblogging platform was co-founded by **Jack Dorsey**, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams.[[32]](#32) It pioneered real-time short text-based updates through **140-character messages** (later expanded to **280 characters** in 2017[[33]](#33)), enabling users to broadcast brief thoughts globally.

Users could follow others, and tweets would appear in a feed, creating a dynamic, ongoing conversation. Key features included:

- **Hashtags** (first proposed by Chris Messina in 2007[[34]](#34)), which enabled the categorization and tracking of topics
- **Retweets** to share and amplify others' posts
- **Mentions** to tag and interact with other users directly

[Twitter](https://twitter.com) became a hub for **real-time news**, pop culture, political discourse, and social movements, allowing users to share opinions, make announcements, and even organize events instantly. Its simplicity and accessibility made it popular among celebrities, journalists, and everyday users. By September 2011, Twitter had more than **100 million users producing 340 million daily tweets**.[[35]](#35)

Over time, Twitter grew into a critical tool for businesses, influencers, activists, real-time news, and political discourse, offering a direct line of communication to global audiences allowing users to share opinions, make announcements, and even organize events. While the platform faced challenges such as combating harassment, misinformation, and user growth, Twitter's impact on communication, particularly in shaping public opinion and sharing news, remains undeniable. Its simplicity and accessibility made it popular among celebrities, journalists, governments, and everyday users.

Following **Elon Musk**'s **\$44 billion acquisition** in 2022[[36]](#36), the platform underwent a radical transformation, replacing its bird logo with an **X** in July 2023[[37]](#37) and migrating its domain to [X.com](https://x.com) by May 2024[[38]](#38), completing Musk's vision for an *'everything app'*.

On March 31, 2023, Twitter open-sourced portions of its recommendation algorithm code as promised by Elon. It turns out the algorithm employs a **three-step process**: candidate sourcing, ranking via a 48-million-parameter neural network, and filtering, to curate a personalized 'For You' feed blending tweets from both followed accounts with relevant content discovered through real-time graph analysis.

## 2010s â€“ The Visual Era

The 2010s were all about **images**, **videos** and **media**.

### Instagram (2010)

Co-founded by Stanford graduates **Kevin Systrom** and **Mike Krieger** in 2010, [Instagram](https://instagram.com) emerged from their failed location-check-in app "Burbn" to dominate mobile photography through retro-inspired filters.[[39]](#39)

This photo-sharing app brought **visual storytelling** to the forefront, allowing users to share their lives through stunning images.

Meta's **\$1 billion acquisition** in 2012[[40]](#40) fueled Instagram's evolution into a multimedia commerce hub via features including:

- Ephemeral **Stories** (2016)[[41]](#41)
- Long-form **IGTV** (2018)
- In-app checkout for **shoppable posts**[[42]](#42)

With over **1 billion active users**[[43]](#43), Instagram remains a leading platform for visual content and social influence.

### Snapchat (2011)

    </sup>
</p>

Emerging from a Stanford University project, [Snapchat](https://snap.com) initially launched as **"Picaboo"** in the iOS App Store in July 2011 under co-founders **Evan Spiegel**, **Bobby Murphy**, and **Reggie Brown**.[[44]](#44) Renamed Snapchat after trademark conflicts, the multimedia messaging app was known for its **disappearing messages** and innovative use of filters.

Core innovations included:

- **Self-destructing photos/videos** after being viewed
- **Stories** (24-hour disappearing content)
- **Lenses** (augmented reality filters)
- **Discover** (news and entertainment content)

Snapchat had a tough start facing legal challenges over its original name. Co-founder Reggie Brown's subsequent lawsuit alleging intellectual property theft resulted in a **\$157.5 million settlement**.[[45]](#45) However, this didn't stop the app from becoming a massive success. From 25 images/second in 2012 to **400 million daily snaps** by late 2013, outpacing Facebook's photo uploads at the time.[[46]](#46) Snapchat crossed the **one million users** threshold by the end of 2012 and grew to **34.8 million daily active users** by the end of 2013.[[47]](#47)

Snapchat **revolutionized communication** with its disappearing stories, making short-lived messages and moments an essential part of digital interaction, fostering authenticity and spontaneity.

Beyond its signature vanishing media, Snapchat expanded into:

- AR-driven face filters (2015)
- Geotagged Stories (2013)
- Discover's publisher partnerships (2015)[[48]](#48)
- **Snap Map** feature (2017) which sparked privacy debates despite its Ghost Mode opt-out[[49]](#49)
- **Memories** (2016) for content archiving[[50]](#50)
- **Spotlight** (2020) for TikTok-style clips[[51]](#51)
- **Lens Studio** (2017) enabling third-party AR filter creation[[52]](#52)

Despite facing competition from platforms like Instagram and TikTok, Snapchat remains a significant social media platform, particularly known for its **creativity**, **privacy features**, and strong engagement with its **Gen Z user base**.[[53]](#53)

## 2020s â€“ Short Videos and Reels Take Over

In the 2020s, social media platforms like **TikTok**, **Instagram Reels**, and **YouTube Shorts** began to gain popularity with **bite-sized video content**. These platforms made it easy for anyone to become a content creator, and videos became the go-to medium for storytelling, entertainment, and education.

### TikTok

    </sup>
</p>

The timeline for [TikTok](https://tiktok.com) is complicated. **ByteDance** launched **Douyin** (TikTok's Chinese version) in China in September 2016, later introducing TikTok globally in September 2017.[[54]](#54) ByteDance then went ahead acquiring **Musical.ly** for **\$1 billion** in November 2017 and merged it with TikTok in August 2018, adding its 100 million users to TikTok's user base.[[55]](#55)[[56]](#56)

On top of this, TikTok leveraged **algorithm-driven content recommendations** and **short-form video format** to fuel viral growth, creating the global phenomenon we know today.[[57]](#57)[[72]](#72) This short-form video format has made it extraordinarily popular across age groups, and among content creators as well as content consumers.

With this format, now anyone can become a content creator and share their content with the world. And for content consumers, it's a great way to discover new content and be entertained. Although this has sparked a lot of debates about the impact of this format on society, and introduced what is known as **"Reel culture"** and **"Doom Scrolling"**, it's undeniable that it has changed the way we consume content and the way we have increased our "screen time" online.

TikTok also sparked a lot of controversies, from **privacy concerns** to the spread of **misinformation**, and even the **banning of the app** in some countries.[[58]](#58)

### Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts

<p align="center">

        </a>
    </sup>
</p>

[Meta](https://www.meta.com)'s Instagram countered TikTok's rise by launching **Reels** globally on **August 5, 2020** across 50+ countries, offering 15-second multi-clip videos with licensed music and AR effects.[[59]](#59)[[60]](#60)

Capitalizing on India's 2020 TikTok ban, YouTube introduced **Shorts** in September 2020 as a beta in India.[[61]](#61) The platform then expanded to the United States in March 2021 and later rolled out to 100+ countries by July 2021.[[62]](#62) The feature quickly gained popularity, reaching **6.5 billion daily views** by March 2021 according to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.[[63]](#63) While TikTok later expanded to 3-minute videos in 2021, YouTube Shorts initially maintained its 60-second limit until 2024.

This demonstrates how the **short-video format** has become the dominant format for social media platforms, and how it has become the default way for people to consume content currently. With the growing popularity and user engagement through endless scrolling, this short video format has been adopted by other platforms like Facebook, Snapchat, and even LinkedIn recently, which has expanded its vertical video capabilities for professional content.[[64]](#64) Some news platforms like the *New York Times* and the *Washington Post* have also adopted this format to keep up with the trend.[[65]](#65)

### The Digital Revolution Continues

From the early days of simple online profiles to the fast-paced world of short-form video and real-time interaction, social media has undergone a **remarkable transformation**.

What started as a way to connect with friends has evolved into a **global stage** for expression, influence, activism, and storytelling.

With each new platform, we've redefined how we share our lives, build communities, and shape the culture around us. As we continue this digital journey, one thing is certain â€” social media isn't just evolving; **it's reshaping the way we experience the world**.
