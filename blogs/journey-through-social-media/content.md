# The journey of Social Media

## The Evolution of social media

Social media as we know it today didn’t happen overnight. It’s been a journey of innovation, creativity, and rapid change. Let’s explore the journey of social media and how it evolved into the endless scrolling experience we’re all familiar with today!
## 1997 – Six Degrees: The Beginning of Online Connections

SixDegrees.com, founded by Andrew Weinreich in 1997, was the first true social networking site, allowing users to create profiles, list friends, and view their friends' networks. It introduced a whole new way in social interaction online beyond emails and forums, laying the foundation for future platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn. Named after the "six degrees of separation" theory, it highlighted how people could connect globally through a few intermediaries. Despite its innovation, SixDegrees struggled with user engagement and revenue, leading to its closure in 2001. Though SixDegrees was ahead of its time, it showed that people wanted to connect with each other online in a social networked way. It proved that creating online communities was a viable concept, even though the society were not fully ready for such a platform in the late 1990s.
In short, SixDegrees was a predecessor to the modern social media age, and its idea of connecting people through mutual acquaintances directly influenced later social networking sites.
