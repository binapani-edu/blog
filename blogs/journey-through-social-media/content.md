# The journey of Social Media

## The Evolution of social media

Social media as we know it today didn't happen overnight. It's been a journey of innovation, creativity, and rapid change. Let's explore the journey of social media and how it evolved into the endless scrolling experience we're all familiar with today!

## The Beginning of Online Connections

### Six Degrees (1997)

SixDegrees.com, founded by Andrew Weinreich in 1997, was the first true social networking site, allowing users to create profiles, list friends, and view their friends' networks. It introduced a whole new way in social interaction online beyond emails and forums, laying the foundation for future platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn.

Named after the "six degrees of separation" theory, it highlighted how people could connect globally through a few intermediaries. Despite its innovation, SixDegrees struggled with user engagement and revenue, leading to its closure in December 2000.

Though SixDegrees was ahead of its time, it showed that people wanted to connect with each other online in a social networked way. It proved that creating online communities was a viable concept, even though the society were not fully ready for such a platform in the late 1990s.

In short, SixDegrees was a predecessor to the modern social media age, and its idea of connecting people through mutual acquaintances directly influenced later social networking sites.

## Early 2000s – Networking Takes Off

The early 2000s saw the rise of social networking sites that catered to different needs.

### Friendster (2002-2003)

One of the first to give users a fun space to network, connecting people based on mutual friends.
Launched in March 2003 by Jonathan Abrams and initially based in Mountain View, California, Friendster quickly became one of the first widely popular social networking platforms, allowing users to create detailed profiles, connect with friends, and discover new people through mutual connections. Its key features included personalized profiles, friend lists based on real-life connections, public "testimonials" for social validation, private messaging, and interest-based communities.

Friendster was unique for its focus on real identities and social relationships, encouraging connections through a "circle of friends" approach. While it was a trendsetter and directly inspired platforms like MySpace and Facebook, Friendster's decline began due to technical issues, poor user experience, and stronger competition from MySpace and Facebook, which offered better features and performance. 

After its decline as a social network, Friendster relaunched as a social gaming platform in June 2011, reaching over 115 million registered users. However, the platform eventually suspended all services in 2015, citing "the evolving landscape in our challenging industry" and lack of user engagement.

### MySpace (2003)

It sparked a wave by letting it's users customize their profiles with personal information and photos, blog posts, and ability to share music, truly putting creativity and freedom for self-expression at the forefront. The platform featured a "Top 8" friends list, built-in blogging tools, and integrated music players, making it especially popular among musicians who used it to promote their work. Launched in August 2003 by Tom Anderson and Chris DeWolfe, MySpace quickly became the world's most popular social networking site in the mid-2000s.

MySpace also included messaging, comments, and groups, fostering a sense of community. Its music integration helped launch artists like Arctic Monkeys and Lily Allen, and by August 2006, MySpace had over 100 million users, surpassing Google as the most visited website in the U.S. Its high level of personalization and focus on music set it apart, making it a cultural and technological milestone and it was acquired by News Corporation for $580 million. The acquisition of MySpace proved initially profitable, as Rupert Murdoch nearly doubled his investment through a later deal with Google worth $900 million.

However, its popularity declined sharply after the rise of Facebook, which offered a cleaner design, better user experience, and more privacy controls. By the early 2010s, MySpace had rebranded as a music-focused platform but never regained its former position. Despite its fall, MySpace paved the way for future social media platforms by showing the power of online communities, user-generated content, and personalized digital identities, making it a cultural and technological milestone in the development of social networking, before Facebook eventually overtook it.

### LinkedIn (2003)

Professional networking made its debut, turning the digital world into a place for career development and business connections. While LinkedIn's development began in Reid Hoffman's living room in 2002, it officially launched on May 5, 2003 by Hoffman along with Allen Blue, Konstantin Guericke, Eric Ly, and Jean-Luc Vaillant, becoming the first social networking platform designed specifically for professional use, offering a digital space where individuals could build and manage their careers online.

Unlike other early social platforms focused on personal or entertainment-based connections, LinkedIn emphasized real identities, formal networking, and career development. Users created detailed profiles that served as digital résumés, listing work history, education, skills, and endorsements. The platform enabled professionals to connect with colleagues, mentors, and industry peers.

Key features included job listings, messaging, peer recommendations, skill endorsements, interest-based groups, and the ability to publish professional content. LinkedIn also launched LinkedIn Learning, offering a wide range of online courses for career advancement. 

Its unique focus on the professional world made it a valuable tool for recruiters, businesses, and job seekers, transforming the way hiring and networking function in the digital age. Acquired by Microsoft in 2016 for $26.2 billion, LinkedIn grew to over 900 million members worldwide (not daily active users) and remains the dominant platform for professional networking, recruitment, and personal branding, influencing how individuals and companies connect, collaborate, and grow in their respective industries.

### Facebook (2004)

The Giant Emerges. Launched in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg, along with Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, Facebook began as a college networking site exclusively for Harvard students, before expanding to other universities and eventually to the general public.

Facebook allowed users to create detailed profiles, add friends, share updates, photos, and links, and interact through comments, likes, and messages. It introduced the News Feed, a feature that displayed real-time updates from friends, which transformed how users consumed content online. Facebook also introduced the concept of "Pages" for businesses, celebrities, and public figures, allowing them to interact with fans directly.

Over the years, Facebook acquired other platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus VR, expanding its influence in social media, messaging, and virtual reality. Facebook changed its name to Meta on October 28, 2021. This rebrand was part of a broader strategic shift focused on building the metaverse, a virtual shared space. The new name, Meta, reflects the company's vision beyond social media and its ambition to be a technology company that builds and connects people in virtual worlds.

Despite facing challenges such as privacy concerns, the spread of misinformation, and competition from newer platforms, Facebook has stayed at the forefront of global social networking, with billions of active users worldwide.

### Twitter (2006)

Launched in 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams, Twitter quickly revolutionized how people communicate and share information online. Originally conceived as a platform for sharing short, status updates in real-time, Twitter initially allowed users to post 140-character messages called "tweets" (later expanded to 280 characters in 2017).

Users could follow others, and tweets would appear in a feed, creating a dynamic, ongoing conversation. Key features included hashtags, which enabled the categorization and tracking of topics, retweets to share others' posts, and mentions to interact with other users directly.

Twitter became a hub for real-time news, pop culture, political discourse, and social movements, allowing users to share opinions, make announcements, and even organize events instantly. Its simplicity and accessibility made it popular among celebrities, journalists, and everyday users. By 2012, Twitter had more than 100 million users producing 340 million daily tweets.

Over time, Twitter grew into a critical tool for businesses, influencers, activists, real-time news, and political discourse, offering a direct line of communication to global audiences allowing users to share opinions, make announcements, and even organize events. While the platform faced challenges such as combating harassment, misinformation, and user growth, Twitter's impact on communication, particularly in shaping public opinion and sharing news, remains undeniable. Its simplicity and accessibility made it popular among celebrities, journalists, governments, and everyday users.

Elon Musk acquired Twitter in October 2022, and it was subsequently rebranded as X in July 2023. The rebranding also included a change of the website URL from twitter.com to x.com in May 2024.

## 2010s – The Visual Era

The 2010s were all about images, videos and media.

### Instagram (2010)

This photo-sharing app brought visual storytelling to the forefront, allowing users to share their lives through stunning images.

Launched in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, Instagram is a photo and video-sharing platform known for its visual content. Users can share posts with filters, use hashtags, and interact through stories and direct messages.

Acquired by Facebook (Meta) in 2012, Instagram introduced features like Reels, IGTV, and shopping, becoming a hub for influencers, brands, and content creators. With over 1 billion active users, Instagram remains a leading platform for visual content and social influence.

### Snapchat (2011)

Snapchat revolutionized communication with its disappearing stories, making short-lived messages and moments an essential part of digital interaction.

Originally launched as "Picaboo" in the iOS App Store in July 2011 by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown, the app was renamed Snapchat later that year. It's a multimedia messaging app known for its disappearing messages and innovative use of filters. Initially focused on sending photos and videos that self-destructed after being viewed, Snapchat evolved to include features like Stories (24-hour content), Lenses (augmented reality filters), and Discover (news and entertainment content).

In 2012, Snapchat crossed the one million users threshold, and by the end of 2013, Snapchat users were sending over 400 million snaps per day. It became popular among younger audiences due to its fun and temporary nature. Over time, Snapchat introduced new features like Snap Map, Memories, and Spotlight (short-form videos), as well as a marketplace for AR lenses. Despite facing competition from platforms like Instagram and TikTok, Snapchat remains a significant social media platform, particularly known for its creativity, privacy features, and strong engagement with its Gen Z user base.

## 2020s – Short Videos and Reels Take Over

In the 2020s, social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts began to gain popularity with bite-sized video content. These platforms made it easy for anyone to become a content creator, and videos became the go-to medium for storytelling, entertainment, and education.

### TikTok

TikTok has a more complex timeline than most social platforms. ByteDance launched Douyin (TikTok's Chinese version) in 2016, and TikTok was launched internationally in September 2017. ByteDance acquired Musical.ly for $1 billion in November 2017 and merged it with TikTok in August 2018, creating the global phenomenon we know today. The platform's algorithm-driven content discovery and short-form video format have made it extraordinarily popular across age groups.

### Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts

In direct response to TikTok's growing popularity, Instagram launched Reels in August 2020, bringing similar short-form video capabilities to its platform. 

YouTube Shorts was first released in India in September 2020 following India's ban of TikTok, then expanded to the United States in March 2021 and globally in July 2021, further demonstrating how the short-form video format had become the dominant social media trend.

With the growing popularity and user engagement with hours and hours of endless scrolling over reels, this reel culture and short video format has been adopted by other platforms like Facebook, Snapchat, and even LinkedIn recently! Some news platforms like the New York Times and the Washington Post have also adopted this format to keep up with the trend.

### The Digital Revolution Continues

From the early days of simple online profiles to the fast-paced world of short-form video and real-time interaction, social media has undergone a remarkable transformation. What started as a way to connect with friends has evolved into a global stage for expression, influence, activism, and storytelling.

With each new platform, we've redefined how we share our lives, build communities, and shape the culture around us. As we continue this digital journey, one thing is certain — social media isn't just evolving; it's reshaping the way we experience the world.
