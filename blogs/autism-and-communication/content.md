# Autism and Communication: Bridging the Gap with Clarity, Empathy, and Inclusion

Communication is often described as a bridge between two people. For many, this bridge is built using spoken words, body language, subtle hints, and shared cultural references. But for many autistic individuals, communication can sometimes feel harder than it needs to be.

Communication differences are a natural part of how autistic people experience and engage with the world. Some speak fluently, some use few or no spoken words, and many communicate through gestures, visual supports, communication boards, or assistive technology. 

What matters most is not how someone communicates, but that their voice (in whatever form it takes) is heard, respected, and valued. In the end, fundamentally, communication is the exchange of information and ideas between two individuals.

## Autism Communication Differences: Moving Beyond the “Deficit” Model

For decades, communication challenges in autism were viewed as something autistic people needed to fix or overcome. Today, research and lived experience offer a more balanced understanding.

### The Double Empathy Problem

The Double Empathy Problem, a concept introduced in 2012 by autistic sociologist Damian Milton, explains that communication breakdowns are often mutual between autistic and non-autistic people.

Autistic and non-autistic individuals can sometimes interpret social cues, emotions, and intentions differently. In many contexts, most autistic people prefer direct language, clarity, and depth of discussion, while most non-autistic people rely more on indirect speech, shared assumptions, sarcasm, or small talk. When these different communication styles meet, misunderstandings and communication gaps can occur on both sides.

The disconnect is not one-sided—it happens when two different ways of experiencing and interpreting the world try to communicate without a shared framework.

### Takeaway

Think of it as two different operating systems attempting to exchange information without a compatible interface. Or like a Japanese-only speaker trying to communicate with an Arabic-only speaker—no interpreter, no shared language. Both are speaking correctly, but are unable to understand each other. The message is not “wrong”—it is simply being processed differently.


## Understanding the Terms: Neurodivergent and Neurotypical

Before going further, it helps to understand two terms often used in conversations about autism and communication.

Neurodivergent describes people whose brains process information, communication, or sensory input differently from what is considered typical. This can include autistic people (ASD), as well as those with ADHD, dyslexia, and other neurological differences.

Neurotypical refers to people whose thinking and communication styles more closely match what society expects as the “usual” way of processing and interacting.

These terms are not labels of ability—they simply describe different ways of experiencing and navigating the world.

## The Directness Disconnect: When Clarity Feels Uncomfortable

A key part of the Double Empathy Problem is the difference in how directness is valued.

Many neurodivergent individuals prioritise accuracy, honesty, and efficiency in communication. The goal is to exchange clear information, not to manage social expectations. In many neurotypical social settings, however, communication is often softened with what can be called social cushioning—polite hints, indirect phrasing, or softened language designed to protect feelings and maintain harmony.

When a neurodivergent person communicates with literal honesty, their words can sometimes be misinterpreted as blunt, rude, or aggressive. From their perspective, they are simply being clear. From the other perspective, the absence of social padding can feel uncomfortable or emotionally jarring.

Neither approach is wrong. They are simply different communication priorities colliding.


## Common Communication Roadblocks

To build better bridges, it helps to recognise everyday language patterns that can feel draining or confusing for many autistic people.

### Idioms and metaphors

Phrases like “pulling your leg” or “reading between the lines” are not meant literally and can be confusing for those who process language more literally.

### Implied meanings

A statement such as “It’s getting a bit late” may actually mean “I want to leave now.” When meaning is implied rather than clearly stated, the message can be missed.

### Sarcasm and tone-based meaning

Sarcasm often relies on vocal tone, facial expression, and shared context, which can add an extra layer of interpretation.

### Vague instructions

Requests like “Do this properly” or “Be sensible” may not provide enough concrete information about what is expected.

### Rapid topic shifts

Conversations that jump between topics without clear transitions can make it difficult to follow.

### Group conversations

Overlapping voices and fast exchanges can make processing spoken language overwhelming.

### Unspoken social rules

Expectations about eye contact, turn-taking, or small talk are often assumed rather than explained.

Autistic people may find neurotypical social rules confusing, while neurotypical people may misinterpret autistic communication styles. The gap is mutual—not one-sided.

This means responsibility for better communication belongs to everyone. Communication is most effective when both people are able to exchange not just words, but intent, meaning, and understanding.


## Why Inclusive Communication Matters

When we broaden our understanding of communication, we create space for inclusion. Autistic voices bring honesty, creativity, focus, and unique perspectives to families, schools, workplaces, and communities.

Listening beyond tone, delivery style, or social convention allows us to hear the content of what is being shared—and that is where real connection begins.


## How to Practice Inclusive Communication

Small shifts in communication style can make a meaningful difference.

- Be literal and direct:

    Say exactly what you mean. Instead of “Keep an eye on the time,” try “Please tell me when it is 3:00 PM.”

- Provide context:

    Explain the reason behind a request to create a clearer mental picture.

- Allow processing time:

    Pause after asking a question to allow time for response.

- Reframe ‘bluntness’ as clarity:

    Try to receive direct communication at face value rather than searching for hidden intent.


## The Future of Autism Communication Support

Some researchers and developers are exploring ways technology can support clearer communication for neurodivergent individuals. This includes AAC apps, visual communication systems, and emerging AI-supported tools that aim to simplify language, personalise expression, or reduce ambiguity in communication. While this field is still evolving and varies in effectiveness, it reflects a growing focus on communication accessibility rather than changing how autistic people naturally communicate.

Autism communication is not about teaching people to “fit in.” It is about meeting people where they are and recognising that diversity in expression enriches us all.

In a world that often values speed and uniformity, autistic communication invites us to slow down, listen carefully, and connect with authenticity.
